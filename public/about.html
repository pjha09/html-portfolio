<p>Hello! I am a Priyanka Jha. A Front-end Developer and graduate of Information Technology. 
  I create successful websites that are fast, easy to use, and built with best practices</p>

<p>I work to make a better web; one that is fast, easy to use, beautiful, accessible to all, and frustration-free. 
  Regardless of your specific business requirements, in solving these challenges, you have a great chance of finding success online.</p>

<p>My main experience is in front-end development but I also have a passion for design. 
  Given that producing a modern website requires the combination of design, server technology, and the layer that users interacts with, I believe having experience in both design and development allows for making the most optimal user experiences.</p></i>
